# Arduino Uno Rotary Encoder Simple

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a rotary encoder with an Arduino Uno to detect rotational movements and monitor the encoder's position. A push-button integrated into the encoder is also utilized.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Rotary Encoder Module**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Rotary Encoder to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the CLK pin of the rotary encoder to digital pin 2 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the DT pin of the rotary encoder to digital pin 3 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the SW (push-button) pin of the rotary encoder to digital pin 4 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Ensure to use pull-up resistors or activate internal pull-ups on the Arduino Uno pins if needed.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the rotary encoder module to the Arduino Uno as per the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Rotate the rotary encoder and observe the position value printed in the Serial Monitor.
   - Press the integrated push-button to trigger actions in your project.

#### Applications

- **User Input Devices:** Ideal for creating user input interfaces or menu navigation systems.
- **Rotational Monitoring:** Use in applications where precise rotational movements need to be tracked.
- **Interactive Projects:** Incorporate rotary encoders for interactive control in Arduino-based projects.

#### Notes

- Ensure the rotary encoder is correctly connected and powered according to the specifications.
- Modify the code to implement specific functionalities based on encoder movements and button presses.
- Explore advanced features of rotary encoders such as quadrature encoding for finer control.
